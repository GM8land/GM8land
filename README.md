## Hi, I’m Geoff (He/Him)
### I recently completed a 24-week bootcamp at Rice University studying AI and Machine Learning. 
Some of the key accomplishments and skills I gained and am now proficient in:
- Python coding
- Data sourcing using APIs
- Data cleaning, scaling, and normalization
- Data analysis using Pandas
- Data visualizations using MatPlotlib and Seaborn
- Leveraging supervised and unsupervised machine learning for data insights and forecasting
- Building, leveraging, and optimizing machine learning models for regression, classification, clustering, and time-series forecasting
- Building and fine-tuning neural networks
- Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and transformers
- AI ethics and bias reduction

### This GitHub page contains samples of my work from the course.
